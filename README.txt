Text Bodies:

Our original texts are the script for “Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship
of the Ring” and the pilot episode for “Game of Thrones”.

We had four sample texts that we compared with the original texts. The sample
texts include excerpts from the scripts of: “Lord of the Rings: The Return of
the King”, “Game of Thrones, Season 4 Episode 2”, “Star Wars: Revenge of the
Sith”, and “Modern Family, Season 3 Episode 7”.

Comparisons:

“Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King” was closer to “Lord of the Rings
movie: The Fellowship of the Ring” as expected and “Game of Thrones, Season
4 Episode 2” was closer to the pilot episode of “Game of Thrones” as expected.

“Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith” was closer to the pilot episode for “Game of
Thrones”, but was not significantly more similar to the pilot episode than to
“Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring”. We expected “Star Wars: Revenge
of the Sith”  to be closer to “Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring”
because the time of writing between these two texts was less than the time
between “Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith” and the pilot episode for “Game of
Thrones”.

“Modern Family, Season 3 Episode 7” was closer to the pilot episode for “Game
of Thrones.” This is likely because both TV shows are both written within a few
years of each other, and thus would likely use similar language.

Reflection:
We think that our text classification program worked well. It did not fail on
any cases were the similarities were obvious, such as comparing two episodes
of “Game of Thrones”. While our results for “Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith”
was contradictory to our expectations, it does not mean our function failed.
However, we could improve our function by writing a more efficient stem method
and finding ways to reduce the amount of code needed, perhaps through procedural
decomposition.
