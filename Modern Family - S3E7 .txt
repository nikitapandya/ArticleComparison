There she is! The old library.
That's some late nights in there.
Some of them I even spent studying.
Don't tell your mom.
And maybe don't tell me.
College! He was shielding his eyes from the sun.
Knew it when I hit it.
Phil is taking Haley to visit his Alma Mater.
Loved college.
Mm, we were hoping some of that enthusiasm rubs off on her.
Go, bullfrogs! Dogs.
Bulldogs.
I feel like you do that on purpose.
No, it's just I say "bull, " and I can't remember if it's frogs or dogs.
When I talk to my old friends from college, do we croak or do we bark? I got it.
Hello? No way! Haley, no way! Check it out! After a few beers, my buds and I would jump on these lunch trays and race down this same hill.
Hop on.
- I don't want to to hop on.
- Seriously, you'll get the giggles.
I don't want the giggles.
Hey, honey.
- How's the trip going? - So good.
Go, bullfrogs.
It's dogs.
Oh, sorry.
How's Haley doing? She's she's loving it.
She's loving it.
I showed her the student union.
We visited the dorms.
We sat in on a class.
I really think she's starting to see what college has to offer.
Oh, hang on, Claire.
Go, bulldogs! Manny, who is this Bella girl, and why is her name all over your notebook? Bella's no girl, mom.
She has recently blossomed, like a purple lilac in April.
What do you mean, she blossom? Like, the poo-berty? Yeah.
I'll get it.
Hey, Gloria, your show's about to start.
Record it.
No, the DVR's filling up.
Let's just watch and get it over with.
Gloria's always saying we should do more stuff together.
So I agreed to watch this crazy Colombian soap opera she loves.
"Fuego y hielo.
" Which apparently, is Spanish for "big hair and yelling.
" "Fire and ice.
" It's about human suffering.
I relate to it.
I'm just saying, the guy's a judge.
He can put a shirt on.
- Ay, what is that? - Oh, nothing.
That doesn't look like a nothing.
What is inside? Oh, it's just something I bought.
I'm gonna go open it in my room.
I don't like this.
Manny has never kept a secret from me.
Don't worry about it.
What do you think it could be? Well, right now I'm a little worried it could be the rest of my evening.
Mwah! Bye-bye.
Love you.
Hey, Claire, listen.
Uh, if you want, some of the moms are gonna stay and watch "Gone with the wind" in my new screening room.
I got Pinot! I would love to, but I'm not feeling that great, so I'm probably just gonna go home and rest.
Plus I've seen that movie.
No, I never saw "Gone with the wind," but I have two kids at sleepovers, and Haley's out of town with Phil.
That means I have one night to myself, which happens once every never.
I am not spending it with some gossipy mom who was mean to me in High School.
I need a fun night out.
What the hell is this? No.
I asked you guys for a fun night out, not this.
I-I-I need music and dancing and secondhand smoke.
Oh, please give this place a chance.
It's a great value.
