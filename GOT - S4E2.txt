Why did you come to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn? If the Mountain killed my sister, your father gave the order.
The Lannisters aren't the only ones that pay their debts.
Ser Dontos Once I was a knight, now I am only a fool.
But a living fool, thanks to you.
- It's not a good time.
- It's never a good time.
You have your child bride.
If you want me to leave, just say it.
You told me to come at once if there was anything important.
I'm Jojen Reed.
This is my sister, Meera.
We've come a long way to find you, Brandon.
You're a warg.
It's in your blood.
I don't want you talking to me anymore, until we get to Castle Black.
We're not going to Castle Black.
Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.
I thank God for bringing Melisandre to us.
She gave you a son.
I gave you nothing.
That's not true.
I want to see my daughter.
I am marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden.
You don't really plan on staying in the King's Guard, do you? Ser Jaime Lannister, a 40 year old knight with one hand.
I use my left hand now, Your Grace.
Makes it more of a contest.
- Winterfell is in ruins.
- What happened out there? I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place.
I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out.
- Please - What is your name? Reek Tansy! Tansy! Tansy! Tansy! Tansy! There you are.
I can't see her, Ramsay.
Tansy! If you make it out of the woods, you win! Run, Tansy, run! - Tansy.
- Where is she? Tansy, Tansy, Tansy! Good girls.
Down, girls.
Down.
Well done.
You, too.
- I only wounded her.
- You brought her down.
That's what matters.
A fine shot.
Wasn't it, Reek? A fine shot, master.
My lady.
Please, my lord.
It hurts.
Oh, sweet.
Don't cry.
It will be over soon.
She thinks she's pretty.
Let me put one through her face.
We have to reward the hounds, love.
They did all the hard work.
Why? I did whatever you asked.
But you made Myranda feel jealous.
- Me jealous of her? - My lord, please.
You can see that your presence has become a bit of a problem.
Rip her! Rip her! Rip her! Not so pretty now.
Your new hand, it's nicer than the old one.
Wouldn't you agree, Pod? Is it solid gold? Gilded steel.
You're not eating.
Why is no one eating? My wife wastes away and my brother starves himself.
- I'm not hungry.
- You lost a hand, not a stomach.
Try the boar.
Cersei can't get enough of it since one killed Robert for her.
A toast.
To the proud Lannister children.
The dwarf, the cripple, and the mother of madness.
- Oh! - I'll clean it up.
No, I'll do it.
Leave us.
It's only wine.
I can't fight anymore.
What about your left? I can hold a sword, but all my instincts are wrong.
How can I protect the king when I can hardly wipe my own ass? You're the Lord Commander now.
Command.
