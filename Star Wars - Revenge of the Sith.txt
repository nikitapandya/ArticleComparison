1 EXT. SPACE 

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. 

A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the Main Title, followed by a rollup, which crawls into infinity. 

War! The Republic is crumbling under attacks by the ruthless Sith Lord, Count Dooku. There are heroes on both sides. Evil is everywhere. 

In a stunning move, the fiendish droid leader, General Grievous, has swept into the Republic capital and kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine, leader of the Galactic Senate. 

As the Separatist Droid Army attempts to flee the besieged capital with their valuable hostage, two Jedi Knights lead a desperate mission to rescue the captive Chancellor. . . . 

PAN DOWN to reveal a REPUBLIC ATTACK CRUISER. Continue to PAN with the Cruiser as TWO JEDI STARFIGHTERS enter and head toward an enemy Battle Cruiser. TRUCK with the Jedi Fighters as they maneuver in unison, dodging flack and enemy laser fire. R2-D2 is on Anakin's ship. R4-P17 is on Obi-Wan's ship. A giant space battle is revealed as the tiny Jedi ships continue their assault in a synchronous ballet. 

2 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE 

OBI-WAN bounces through the flack with a frown. His ship rocks violently. 

3 INT. ANAKINS STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE 

ANAKIN smiles as he blasts a TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTER. 

ANAKIN: There isn't a droid made that can out fly you, Master, and no other way to get to the Chancellor . . . 

OBI-WAN: Look out, four droids inbound . . . 

4 EXT. CORUSCANT-SPACE BATTLE 

The TWO JEDI FIGHTERS swerve in unison as FOUR TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS attack. After several clever moves by the Jedi, two of the FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS collide with each other in a ball of flame. 

5 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE 

OBI-WAN struggles to maintain control of his ship. 

OBI-WAN: We've got to split them up. 

ANAKIN: Break left, fly through the guns on that tower. 

OBI-WAN flies to the left of a huge tower on a REPUBLIC CRUISER. The TWO DROID DROP FIGHTERS follow. 

OBI-WAN: Easy for you to say . . . why am I always the bait? 

ANAKIN: Don't worry. I'm coming around behind you. 

OBI-WAN deftly maneuvers around a large Starship's superstructure, but the TWO DROID FIGHTERS stay on his tail, BLASTING him with intense laser fire. 

OBI-WAN: Anakin, they're all over me! 

ANAKIN: Dead ahead! Closing . . . lock onto him, Artoo . . . 

ARTOO BEEPS his reply as ANAKIN swoops in for the kill. ANAKIN BLASTS one of the DROID DROP FIGHTERS. It EXPLODES. 

ANAKIN: (continuing, laughs) We got him, Artoo! 

ANAKIN BLASTS away at the second DROID DROP FIGHTER as ARTOO BEEPS an angry warning. 

ANAKIN: I copy, Artoo. 

OBI-WAN: I'm going down on the deck. 

ANAKIN: Good idea ... I need some room to maneuver. 

OBI-WAN dives toward the surface of one of the larger TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIPS and is forced to fly through a maelstrom of laser flack. He skims the surface, followed by the DROID DROP FIGHTER, which is followed by ANAKIN. 

ANAKIN: (continuing) Cut right. Do you hear me?! Cut right. Don't let him get a handle on you. Come on, Artoo, lock on! Lock on!
