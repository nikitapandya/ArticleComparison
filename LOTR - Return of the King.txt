BLACK SCREEN:

EXT. RIVER ANDUIN - DAY

ANGLE ON: SMEAGOL and his cousin, DEAGOL, sit in a SMALL
CORACLE, their FISHING LINES draped over the side . . . SUNSHINE
glinting off the surface of the water.

An idyllic image.

SUDDENLY . . . DEAGOL's FISHING ROD BENDS under the weight of a
LARGE FISH.

                        DEAGOL
                 (excited)
            Smeagol, I've got one!
                 (he laughs)
            I've got a fish, Smeagol!

                       SMEAGOL
                 (excitedly)
            Go on, pull it in.

DEAGOL pulls on his ROD, but is HAULED OVERBOARD and
disappears underwater with a SPLASH!

ANGLE ON: SMEAGOL leaning over the BOAT . . . CONCERNED.

                       SMEAGOL (cont'd)
                 (worried)
            Deagol!

EXT. UNDERWATER, RIVER ANDUIN - DAY

ANGLE ON: DEAGOL is towed to the RIVER BED by a LARGE FISH
. . . he suddenly lets go of the line . . . eyes fixed on a
SHINING GOLD RING, lying in 'the SILT.


EXT. RIVER ANDUIN, GLADDEN FIELDS - DAY



CLOSE ON: the RING   revealed in DEAGOL'S PALM . . .

ANGLE ON: SMEAGOL peers over his shoulder . . . the GOLD
reflects in SMEAGOL'S EYES!

                     SMEAGOL
           Give us that, Deagol, my love!

DEAGOL turns to look at him, a smirk on his face.

                      DEAGOL
           Why?

CLOSE ON: SMEAGOL moves towards DEAGOL . . .

                     SMEAGOL
           Because its my birthday, and I wants it.

ANGLE ON: SMEAGOL jumps on DEAGOL . . . STRANGLING HIM! SMEAGOL
rips the GLITTERING RING from DEAGOL'S LIMP HAND.

                      SMEAGOL (cont'd)
           My precious!

CLOSE ON: SMEAGOL slips the RING onto his FINGER and DISAPPEARS.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MISTY MOUNTAINS CAVES - DAY

IMAGES: SMEAGOL descending into madness. His body TWISTS and
DISTORTS . . . he becomes a CREEPY, SHRIVELLED wretch . . . finally
crawling into a DARK CAVE beneath the MISTY MOUNTAINS.

                     SMEAGOL
           They cursed us. Murderer. Murderer they
           called us. They cursed us and drove us
           away.

                        SMEAGOL (cont'd)
             And we wept, Precious, we wept to be so
             alone. And we forgot the taste of bread,
             the sound of trees, the softness of the
             wind . . . We even forgot our own name.
                  (in a choking cough)
             Gollum! Gollum!

ANGLE ON: GOLLUM in the CAVE staring at the RING in his hand.

                        GOLLUM
             It's mine! My own. It came to me.

                        SMEAGOL
                  (ecstatic)
             My Precious.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. CULVERT, VALE OF MORGUL - DAWN

ANGLE ON: A GRIM LANDSCAPE, covered in THORN BUSHES and the
scars of RECENT FIRES. The DARK MORGUL VALLEY disappears up
towards the MOUNTAINS.

SETTLE ON: FRODO and SAM in a FILTHY CULVERT.
SAM twitches in a RESTLESS SLEEP. But FRODO is awake . . . His
hand trails down to the CHAIN around his NECK ...

A SUDDEN HISS! FRODO quickly hides the RING as GOLLUM peers
at them with GLEAMING EYES.

                        GOLLUM
             Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, sleepies! We
             must go, yes, we must go at once!

SAM STIRS, looks at FRODO . . .

                        SAM
             Haven't you had any sleep, Mr Frodo?

FRODO shakes his HEAD.

                        SAM (cont'd)
             I've gone and had too much
